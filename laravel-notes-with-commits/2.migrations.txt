Migration : Laravel Migration is an essential feature in Laravel that allows you to create a table in your database. It allows you to modify and share the application's database schema. You can modify the table by adding a new column or deleting an existing column.
migration class contains two methods, i.e., up() method and down() method. The up() method is used to create the new table, add the new columns or indexes to the database while the down() method is the opposite of the up() method, i.e., it Rollback changes and drops the fields.
