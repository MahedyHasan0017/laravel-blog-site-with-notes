adding this line inside 

class BlogPost extends Model {

use SoftDeletes ; 

public static function boot(){
        parent::boot() ; 

        //this method will run before blogPost model instance post deleted
        // at first it will delete comments then it will delete post 
        static::deleting(function(BlogPost $blogPost){
            $blogPost->comments()->delete() ; 
        });
    }

}

deleting a post with id number : 3  // we will notice that deleted_at field is not null of this post 
 then finding deleted post with

 $post = BlogPost::onlyTrashed()->find(3)
 
 and restoring it  using 
 $post->restore() 

now the post will restore and deleted_at value will be null 

$post->forceDelete() ; 
//this will delete post from database permanently
