adding form with @csrf and submitting best practice table column name and input field name should be same

installing toaster 

run these commands 
composer require yoeunes/toastr
php artisan flasher:install

now use in code 
// Display a success toast with no title
flash()->success('Operation completed successfully.');

toastr()->success('Data has been saved successfully!');


toastr()->error('An error has occurred please try again later.');



when we will use create then we must enable mass assignment in out BlogPost model 
with  protected $fillable = ['field-name-1','field-name-2',...] ; 

want to track time then public $timestamps = true should add on model 


to make a form input fields reusable
