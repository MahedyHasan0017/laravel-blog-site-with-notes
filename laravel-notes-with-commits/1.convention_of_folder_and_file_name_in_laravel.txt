Models: Always singular and PascalCase. E.g., User.

--Naming Model Relationships When defining relationships in your models, use camelCase. For instance, name it publishedLessons(), not published_lessons():


Controllers: Typically plural and ending with the word ‘Controller’. E.g., PostsController.

Blade Files: Typically kebab-case and matching their related controllers. E.g., for PostsController, use posts-index.blade.php.

--Avoid: Naming like BookView.blade.php for a show method in the controller.
--Adopt: Naming patterns such as books/index.blade.php, books/show.blade.php, and so on.


Migrations: Descriptive and snake_case, explaining the action. E.g., create_users_table.


Route:

Route::get('/posts/{post}', function ($postId) {
    //
})->name('posts.show'); ///naming route convention with .
