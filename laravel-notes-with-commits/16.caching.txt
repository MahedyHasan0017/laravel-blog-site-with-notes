always quering data from database can be cause of slow performance of our application.
to solve this problem we have a option named caching , caching is a secondary storage 
caching store data , and return data from it respect to query, so that direct quering to database can be reduce 
and performance of application be faster 

how caching works caching is the middle state of our application 
first state is controller second is cache and last is database

controller request data to database at first request go to cache if it finds
expected data then immidiately return data 
if request not find expected data then it will goto to data base table and fetch data and return
