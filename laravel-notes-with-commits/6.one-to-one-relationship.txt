best example for one to one relationship is 
***user and profile one user has one profile or one profile belongs to one user***
user table has basic user data and profile table has more data about user 

$table->unsignedBigInteger('author_id')->unique();
$table->foreign('author_id')->references('id')->on('authors');

practice in tinker 

//assigning data 

$author = new Author()
$author->save()
Author::all()
$pro = new Profile()
$author->profile()
Author::all()
$author->profile->save($pro)
$pro = new Profile()
$pro->save()
$pro->author_id = 1
$pro->save()
Profile::all()
$author = new Author()
$author->save()
$profile = new Profile()
$author->profile()->save($profile)
$author = Author::create()
$profile = new Profile()
$profile->author()->associate($author)->save()
$profile
$author


//reading data 


$pro = Profile::find(2)
$auth = Author::find(3)

$pro->author()
$pro->author
$pro 

$author
$author = Author::with('profile')->whereKey(1)->first()
$author = Author::with(['profile','comment'])->whereKey(1)->first()
